          <p>
            If you’ve had to cancel or change your non-refundable flight, most
            airlines will offer you a credit instead of a refund. Here’s the
            things you should know.
          </p>
          <h4><b> Using Your FLight credit issued due to COVID 19 </b></h4>
          <p>
            First, you will need to have the itinerary number, credit amount,
            and traveler name(s) handy to get started. Your flight credit can be
            used immediately. Currently, the only option to redeem a flight
            credit for future use, is by calling us. Given the high demand, we
            are prioritizing work on online solutions. We look forward to
            providing you an update here soon.
          </p>
          <h4><b>COVID-19 flight credit rules:</b></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The airlines are setting the policies for how you can redeem your
              airline credit.
            </li>
            <li>Each airline credit is in the original traveler’s name.</li>
            <li>
              Airline credits cannot be combined or transferred to another
              person.
            </li>
            <li>
              Airline credits must be used for air travel, including taxes and
              fees, with the airline that originally issued the ticket.
            </li>
            <li>Airline credits cannot be used for ancillary services.</li>
            <li>
              Airline credit comes with a travel-by date (sometimes called
              credit validity), so be sure to factor that into your planning. As
              soon as we confirm your credit validity date with our partner, we
              will communicate it to you via email.
            </li>
            <li>
              For travel originally scheduled between March 19th and April 30th,
              we confirmed with our airline partner, that any applicable change
              fees would be waived.
            </li>
          </ul>

              >Not affected by COVID-19? Here's the scoop on using your flight
              credit
            </b>
          </h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Airline credit comes with a travel-by date, so be sure to factor
              that into your planning. (See your cancellation email for your
              specific ticket policies and details.)
            </li>
            <li>
              Airlines give separate credits to each traveler; you won’t be able
              to combine or transfer credits.
            </li>
            <li>
              This credit can be used only by the person whose name is on the
              ticket, and only with the airline that provided the credit.
            </li>
            <li>
              Your new flight must depart from the same country as was shown on
              your original ticket.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you choose a different destination when booking with an airline
              credit, some taxes may be forfeited, and new ones introduced. Bear
              in mind that this can impact the amount of your flight credit and
              how you can use it.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All details of your airline credit, such as traveler name, credit
            amount, ticket number and expiration date, are in your confirmation
            email.

          </ol>
          <h4><b>Good to know</b></h4>
          <li>
            If your new flight costs more than your airline credit amount, you
            must pay any remaining difference.
          </li>
          <li>
            If your new flight costs less than your airline credit amount, you
            could potentially forfeit the remaining value depending on the
            airline policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            To redeem an airline credit from a low-cost airline, contact the
            airline directly.

            When you browse Expedia’s European Union (EU) websites and book a
            property that’s located in the EU/European Economic Area (EEA), it
            may be provided by a professional host (this is generally the case)
            or it may be provided by a private host.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have a professional host, that means it’s their job to offer
            properties for booking — it’s part of their trade, business, or
            profession.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the property has told us they are a ‘private host,’ that means
            they’re offering a property for booking, but it’s not something they
            do as a trade, business, or profession. These kinds of properties
            are not subject to the same EU consumer protection rules that apply
            to professional hosts.

            If you find an issue with your booking or have multiple itineraries
            for the same trip, you may be able to change or cancel your booking,
            most often online.
          </p>
          <h4><b> To change or cancel your booking online </b></h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to your itinerary page</li>

            If you cannot locate the <b> Change</b> or <b>Cancel</b> link in
            your itinerary, or cannot successfully complete the change or
            cancellation online, this usually means:

            <li>Your booking is not changeable or cancellable</li>
          </ul>

          <h4><b>Good to know</b></h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Some changes or cancellations are subject to fees. See Change or

            </li>
            <li>
              Some bookings are non-refundable. If you cancel a non-refundable
              booking, you will not receive a refund. See Refund process and
              timelines for details.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prior to initiating a change or cancellation, please review the
              detailed rules and restrictions in your itinerary.

              If you don't check in during your hotel's check-in hours, or never
              show up without canceling first, the hotel may charge you a
              no-show penalty fee. This fee can vary, so check the Rules and
              restrictions in your itinerary for your hotel's policies.
